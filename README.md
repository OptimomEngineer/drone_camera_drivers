drone camera drivers for ps3 camera
this camera driver comes from this website: http://kaswy.free.fr/?q=node/38#ps3

it allows you to use the camera in ubuntu. I will be installing this to use on a ubuntu core on a raspberry three pi using a ubuntu classic overlay in order for installation.

This will allow us to record audio and have the sphinx program decode and send out text after i build a library for the sphinx program.

the sphinx program information can be found here: http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/doc/Sphinx.html
